<h2>📝 Description:</h2>
<p>This project is a digital rendition of the classic checkers board game, developed in C# using Visual Studio. It features a user-friendly interface built with Windows Forms, following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern for clean code architecture and easy maintenance.</p>

<h2>📌 Game Rules:</h2>
<p>Checkers is a classic board game played between two players on an 8x8 grid gameboard. Here are the basic rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Each player starts with 12 pieces (checkers) placed on the dark squares of the three rows closest to them. One player has dark pieces (usually black) and the other has light pieces (usually white).</li>
  <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward on the dark squares. Regular pieces can only move forward, but once a piece reaches the opponent's back row, it becomes a "king" and gains the ability to move both forward and backward.</li>
  <li><strong>Capturing:</strong> If a player's piece is adjacent to an opponent's piece and the square beyond it is empty, the player can "jump" over the opponent's piece, capturing it. Multiple captures can be made in a single turn if they are in a consecutive diagonal line.</li>
  <li><strong>King's Movement:</strong> Kings can move both forward and backward diagonally, capturing opponent's pieces in both directions.</li>
  <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal is to capture all of the opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot make any legal moves.</li>
  <li><strong>End of Game:</strong> The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or when one player cannot make a legal move.</li>
</ul>


<h2>🚀 Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>👥 Multiplayer Mode: Enjoy playing against your friends locally.</li>
  <li>📊 Statistics Tracking: Keep track of your gameplay stats, including wins, losses, and more.</li>
  <li>🔄 Restart: Reset the game board and start a new match with a single click.</li>
  <li>💾 Save & Load: Save your progress and continue your game later with the load feature.</li>
  <li>💥 Game Modes: Allow multiple jumps for capturing more than one enemy piece in your turn or keep it simple.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🖥️ Usage:</h2> 
Execute the application through your IDE. Here you go! Now you can start playing the game!
